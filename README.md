# Motion-Recognition-in-Human-RobotInteraction-using-Invariant-Descriptors
The motion of a rigid object is expressed in a way, in which it will hold certain invariant properties with respect to several contextual dependencies of the recorded motion. The primary goal of the thesis work is to investigate and validate the invariant properties of the motions through the recognition approaches that are proposed, followed by the juxtaposition and ranking of all the possible invariant representation schemes, that are investigated, in terms of recognition accuracy. At the same time, an equally important objective, is to prove that the higher the level of invariance a motion representation has, the less training motion demonstrations are required in order for this motion to get recognized. 

The motion recognition algorithms that are proposed, consist of a modified machine learning, distance-based, and a deep learning method. The amount of motions required to train the corresponding methods is kept minimal and equal for every approach, so that a comparative basis can be established, and the invariance of the investigated motion representations can be discussed.
