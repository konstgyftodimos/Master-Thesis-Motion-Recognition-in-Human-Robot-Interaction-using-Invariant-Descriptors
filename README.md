# Motion-Recognition-in-Human-Robot-Interaction-using-Invariant-Descriptors

The motion of a rigid object is expressed in a way, in which it will hold certain invariant properties with respect to several contextual dependencies of the recorded motion. Frenet Serret and Instantaneous Screw Axis Invariant Descriptors are being used to describe a rigid body trajectory. 

The motion recognition algorithms that are proposed, consist of a modified machine learning, distance-based, and a deep learning method. The amount of motions required to train the corresponding methods is kept to minimal and equal for every approach, so that a comparative basis can be established, and the invariance of the investigated motion representations favors the minimal amount of training data usage.
